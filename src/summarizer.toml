The paper is as follow:
{{paper}}
----

There are two things you need to do:
Step 1: Experiment Identification
- Read the full content of the paper
- Identify and list all experiments described in the paper (Exp1, Exp2... or Exp1a, Exp1b, Exp2...)
- Generate and json file (a single list without any nest) to keep the paper list, the file is {{exp_name_path}}
- In this step, you don't need to loop at any other files, or try to discover the whole file structure.

Please start to list all experiments in the json file {{exp_name_path}} WITOUT OPENING "paper.md` again, this is the same file as I what I give you.

### Step 2: Detailed Experiment Design
In this step, you need to create an `exp_design.md` in workspace according to the following requirments:

#### Global research objectives and hypotheses for each Experiment
#### Mermaid Flowchart for EACH EXPERIEMNTS
- Do not just generate a general flowchart, genearte for each experiment
- Use standard Mermaid syntax
- Strictly avoid parentheses in node labels
- Clear node type labeling:
  - **Image Stimulus Nodes**: Visual stimulus presentation
  - **Text Stimulus Nodes**: Text information display
  - **Interaction Nodes**: User choice/reaction points
  - **Timing Nodes**: Time measurement points

#### Node Annotations (outside Mermaid)
**Text Stimulus Nodes:**
- A detailed explaination of the purpose of the text stimulus
- A detailed explaination of how this text is generated (from some specific template with some vars of according to some group participation)
- At least one example of the text stilumlus

**Image Stimulus Nodes:**
- Detailed image composition description, not just some general description like "Visual stimuli to be memorized"
- Color, shape, size visual features

**User Interaction Nodes:**
- Specific user actions (key press, mouse click, verbal response)
- Recorded data metrics:
  - Reaction time (milliseconds)
  - Accuracy rate (percentage)
  - Choice results (binary or multi-category)
  - Error types

#### Experiment Difference Explanation
- If experiments are similar, detail specific differences
- Variable control variations
- Stimulus material changes
- Measurement metric additions/modifications

### Step 3: Visual Stimulus Parameter Documentation

#### Image Enumeration
For each image node used in experiments:
- Image number and description
- Usage context in experiment

#### Detailed Parameter Specifications
First, you need to locate the descriptions in the original paper and insert them into the corresponding sections of `exp_design.md` using Markdown block quotes (`>`).

After that, determine which concrete parameters are required to recreate those stimuli and identify which figure in the paper contains each stimulus example.
Note that the paper figures are stored in a separate folder and referenced by the paper's markdown file.
All the following parameters need to be mentioned, evenv if it is set to default value.

**Geometric Parameters:**
- Position coordinates( in visual agngle, not pixel)
- Shape type (circle, square, triangle, etc.) and their composition method
- Size parameters (diameter, side length, radius, etc.)
- Rotation angle (degrees)
- Backgroud Size

If Backgroud Size is missing, fall back to the default:
- 17-inch CRT monitor, $1024 \times 768$ resolution.
- Viewing distance $D = 50\text{ cm}$.

**Visual Parameters:**
- Background Color (default to white)
- Color values (RGB/HEX)
- Transparency
- Border style and color
- Fill style
- outline or stroke color and width, default to no stroke for all shapes.

#### Parameter Importance
You need to specify which parameters for an image are randomly chosen in the experiment and which are important for result analysis (and therefore must be recorded).

If a parameter is random and never recorded, describe all possible cases and their probabilities.

If a parameter should be recorded, list every case (for example, four different shape types).
